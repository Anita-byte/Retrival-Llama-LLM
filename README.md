A Retrieval-Based LLM optimizes the use of small datasets, such as a two-page text, by effectively combining information retrieval and language generation. This setup ensures precise, context-aware responses, making it ideal for scenarios where localized or domain-specific knowledge is critical. Despite some challenges, the modelâ€™s adaptability and efficiency render it a powerful tool in applications requiring focused knowledge extraction.
